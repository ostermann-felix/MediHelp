### What is [MediHelp](https://medihelp.vercel.app/)?<br>

The app [MediHelp](https://medihelp.vercel.app/) is a mobile solution for motorists, volunteer paramedics and anyone who passes by an accident or helpless people, to show them at the place of action what to do.
Take for example an elderly woman who passed out on the streets. With this app everybody can look up a stable lateral position and how to do it step by step in just a few seconds of time. No struggling with searching the internet and no wasted time as a passerby or random first responder.<br><br>
